- Can I just use a different time integrator? Even with dimensional splitting? 
- Is my proposed definition of shock curves workable? (non-intersecting, parametrizable in x or y (or a transform thereof))
 - If yes, then how do we write the shock shift? I think it works if we stick everything to a parametrization in x or y
 - What about self-crossing, bending, etc etc
- As a limitation we will have "there must be exactly one shock curve, parametrizable in x"
 - This is fine. "Future Work" exists as section for a reason
- "weak limit in a space of measures" is a phrase I keep seeing that I can't manage to understand
- I can show that tangent-of-average is the same as average-of-tangent (or at least, I think I can.) Should this be done?
